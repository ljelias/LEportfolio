          <h2>A bit about me...</h2>
          <p>When life finally forced me to admit that I needed a new career avenue with better employment prospects, 
              web development was an easy choice. I had considered majoring in computer science as an undergrad, and had 
              totally enjoyed a programming class I took. Having already learned the basics of HTML, I didn't hesitate to jump right in 
              to a 12-week full-stack web development bootcamp at the University of Minnesota.
              From there I went on to the engineering immersion program at Thinkful to further develop my skills. Since I have a wide 
              range of interests, I can envision my web development career path potentially taking several different directions.</p>
          <p>My years of experience in higher education has given me an insider perspective of the educational technology needs 
              of post-secondary students and faculty. I have dealt with a range of technology applications, both good and not-so-good, 
              so I bring a lot to the table from an authentic UX perspective. My field is linguistics and language education, and I 
              believe there is still plenty of room for development in the area of language instruction applications.</p>
          <p>My speciality is in phonetics/phonology/pronunciation, so an area that fascinates me is speech recognition and production. 
              I have a knack for analyzing speech and pronunciation patterns, and my ear automatically tunes in to computer generated 
              speech, whether I want to or not! As I instinctively analyze the unnatural sounding aspects 
              of the techno-voices, I often think things such as: "Don't they realize that in "X" context, "Y" sound 
              is pronounced as "Z"...?" I am sure I have much to bring to the table in the realm of computer-generated speech.</p>
          <p>When Iâ€™m not busy coding or writing down language examples in my notebook, you will most likely find me involved in 
              urban farming and community gardening activities, playing my cello, hanging a cabinet in my kitchen, or swimming or 
              biking with my sons.</p>

              <h4>Basic Quiz App</h4>
              <div class='clearfix'><img class='galleryPic' src='/assets/MNquizApp.PNG' alt='screenshot of quiz app' />
                <p>A simple multiple-choice quiz app featuring questions about Minnesota. Give it a try!</p>
                <p>This was built with my pair-programming partner James L.</p>
                <p>Technologies: html / css / javascript</p>

            <h4>My Bookmark Manager</h4>
            <p>An easier way to keep track of your favorite sites!</p>
            <div class='clearfix'>
              <img class='galleryPic' src='/assets/bookmarkApp.PNG' alt='screenshot of bookmark app' />
              <p>This app is better than using browser bookmarks or favorites. You can keep notes for each site 
                and give a rating from 1 to 5 stars. You can easily delete any bookmark or look at only the bookmarks above a certain rating.</p>
