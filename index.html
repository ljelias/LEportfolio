          <h2>A bit about me...</h2>
          <p>I first completed a 12-week full-stack web development bootcamp and the University of Minnesota, and then went on 
              to the engineering immersion program at Thinkful to further develop my skills. I have a wide range of interests, 
              so my I can envision my web development career path potentially taking several different directions.</p>
          <p>My years of experience in higher education has given me an insider perspective of the educational technology needs 
              of post-secondary students and faculty. I have dealth with a range of technology applications, both good and not-so-good, 
              so I bring a lot to the table from an authentic UX perspective. My field is linguistics and language education, and I 
              believe there is still plenty of room for development in the area of language instruction applications.</p>
          <p>My speciality is in phonetics/phonology/pronunciation, so an area that fascinates me is speech recognition and production. 
              I have a knack for analyzing speech and pronunciation patterns, and my ear automatically tunes in to computer generated 
              speech --whether I want to or not! I instinctively start to analyze the patterns behind the unnatural sounding parts, 
              and as I listen to the techno-voices, I often think things such as: "Don't they realize that in "X" context, "Y" sound 
              is pronounced as "Z"...?" I am sure I have much to bring to the table in the realm of computer-generated speech.</p>
          <p>When Iâ€™m not busy coding or writing down language examples in my notebook, you will most likely find me involved in 
              urban farming and community gardening activities, playing my cello, hanging a cabinet in my kitchen, or swimming or 
              biking with my sons.</p>
